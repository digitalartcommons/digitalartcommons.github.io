# About
*Digital Art Commons* intends to serve as an open source standards and curriculum development platform for users interested in improving digital art community expectations and education for teachers, industry professionals, and students. It will exist to help build and share learning resources, assignments, assets, and tools to assist educators and students in learning pertinent concepts, software, workflows, and context. The project will also help an open community of users define a common set of learning objectives for courses across various learning platforms and institutions. It aims to bridge professional organizations, and companies with schools, government, and individuals.
